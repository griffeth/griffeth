Hi there 👋

🏁 I work on audit and compliance [@github](https://github.com/github) - see [GitHub.com/Security](https://github.com/security)

💻 strategizing how github approaches compliance with an emphasis in international/global expansion (ISO, TISAX, etc.) and new products (Copilot and GitHub Enterprise Cloud)
